# OpenGL Intro

## About
This was supposed to be an 8 hour introductory OpenGL course at the Computer Science Week on my college. It's a complete application that loads and renders 3D models using a simple realtime Phong renderer featuring an interactive camera. It took a lot of time to thing through and prepare, but they cancelled my course 2 days before it was supposed to happen (it angers me to this date).

## Notes
As this was meant as a quick introduction, it was written in a single source file.

## Running
Even the assets are on the repository, so it should be pretty simple to run it with Visual Studio.
